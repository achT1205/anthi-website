Computer-supported visu- alizations are a well-known solution when humans need to reason based on a large amount of data. The more effective a visualization, the more complex the problems that can be solved. In information visualization research, to be considered effective, a visualization typically needs to support data comprehension. Evaluation methods focus on whether users indeed understand the displayed data, can gain insights and are able to perform a set of analytic tasks, e.g., to identify if two variables are correlated. This dissertation suggests moving beyond this \"visual analysis paradigm\" by extending research focus to another type of task: decision making. Decision tasks are essential to everybody, from the manager of a company who needs to routinely make risky decisions to an ordinary person who wants to choose a career life path or simply find a camera to buy. Yet decisions do not merely involve information understanding and are difficult to study. Decision tasks can involve subjective preferences, do not always have a clear ground truth, and they often depend on external knowledge which may not be part of the displayed dataset. Nevertheless, decision tasks are neither part of visualization task taxonomies nor formally defined. Moreover, visualization research lacks metrics, methodologies and empirical works that validate the effectiveness of visualizations in supporting a decision. This dissertation provides an operational definition for a particular class of decision tasks and reports a systematic analysis to investigate the extent to which existing multidimensional visualizations are compatible with such tasks. It further reports on the first empirical comparison of multidimensional visualizations for their ability to support decisions and outlines a methodology and metrics to assess decision accuracy. It further explores the role of instructions in both decision tasks and equivalent analytic tasks, and identifies differences in accuracy between those tasks. Similarly to vision science that informs visualization researchers and practitioners on the limita- tions of human vision, moving beyond the visual analysis paradigm would mean acknowledging the limitations of human reasoning. This dissertation reviews decision theory to understand how humans should, could and do make decisions and formulates a new taxonomy of cognitive biases based on the user task where such biases occur. It further empirically shows that cognitive biases can be present even when information is well-visualized, and that a decision can be “correct” yet irrational, in the sense that people's decisions are influenced by irrelevant information. This dissertation finally examines how biases can be alleviated. Current methods for improving human reasoning often involve extensive training on abstract principles and procedures that often appear ineffective. Yet visualizations have an ace up their sleeve: visualization designers can re-design the environment to alter the way people process the data. This dissertation revisits decision theory to identify possible design solutions. It further empirically demonstrates that enriching a visualization with interactions that facilitate alternative decision strategies can yield more rational decisions. Through empirical studies, this dissertation suggests that the visual analysis paradigm cannot fully address the challenges of visualization-supported decision making, but that moving beyond can contribute to making visualization a powerful decision support tool.},\nauthor \u003d {Dimara, Evanthia},\npages \u003d {1--234},\nschool \u003d {University Paris Saclay},\ntitle \u003d {{Information Visualization for Decision Making : Identifying Biases and Moving Beyond the Visual Analysis Paradigm}},\nurl \u003d {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01968033v2},\nyear \u003d {2017}\n}\n, shortpreviewvideo: -, presentationslides: -, presentationvideo: -"

We examine whether this cognitive bias, so far only tested with three alternatives and simple presentation formats such as numerical tables, text and pictures, also appears in visualizations. Since visualizations can be used to support decision making - e.g., when choosing a house to buy or an employee to hire - a systematic bias could have important implications. In a first crowdsource experiment, we indeed partially replicated the attraction effect with three alternatives presented as a numerical table, and observed similar effects when they were presented as a scatterplot. In a second experiment, we investigated if the effect extends to larger sets of alternatives, where the number of alternatives is too large for numerical tables to be practical. Our findings indicate that the bias persists for larger sets of alternatives presented as scatterplots. We discuss implications for future research on how to further study and possibly alleviate the attraction effect.},\nauthor \u003d {Dimara, Evanthia and Bezerianos, Anastasia and Dragicevic, Pierre},\ndoi \u003d {10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598594},\nisbn \u003d {1077-2626},\nissn \u003d {1077-2626},\njournal \u003d {IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics},\nmonth \u003d {jan},\nnumber \u003d {1},\npages \u003d {471--480},\npublisher \u003d {IEEE},\ntitle \u003d {{The Attraction Effect in Information Visualization}},\nurl \u003d {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539348/},\nvolume \u003d {23},\nyear \u003d {2017}\n}\n, shortpreviewvideo: https://vimeo.com/182971122, presentationslides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A5pp3kD5OKAFePpaygq4sWevLAJqSS8d/view?usp\u003dsharing, presentationvideo: https://vimeo.com/226491954"

We examine whether this cognitive bias, so far only tested with three alternatives and simple presentation formats such as numerical tables, text and pictures, also appears in visualizations. Since visualizations can be used to support decision making - e.g., when choosing a house to buy or an employee to hire - a systematic bias could have important implications. In a first crowdsource experiment, we indeed partially replicated the attraction effect with three alternatives presented as a numerical table, and observed similar effects when they were presented as a scatterplot. In a second experiment, we investigated if the effect extends to larger sets of alternatives, where the number of alternatives is too large for numerical tables to be practical. Our findings indicate that the bias persists for larger sets of alternatives presented as scatterplots. We discuss implications for future research on how to further study and possibly alleviate the attraction effect.},\nauthor \u003d {Dimara, Evanthia and Bezerianos, Anastasia and Dragicevic, Pierre},\ndoi \u003d {10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598594},\nisbn \u003d {1077-2626},\nissn \u003d {1077-2626},\njournal \u003d {IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics},\nmonth \u003d {jan},\nnumber \u003d {1},\npages \u003d {471--480},\npublisher \u003d {IEEE},\ntitle \u003d {{The Attraction Effect in Information Visualization}},\nurl \u003d {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539348/},\nvolume \u003d {23},\nyear \u003d {2017}\n}\n"

Rather than using a traditional wand device, users can manipulate objects with fingers of both hands in a close-to-natural manner for moderately complex, general purpose tasks. Our solution couples finger tracking with a real-time physics engine, combined with a heuristic approach for hand manipulation, which is robust to tracker noise and simulation instabilities. A first study has been performed to evaluate our interface, with tasks involving complex manipulations, such as balancing objects while walking in the cube. The user's finger-tracked manipulation was compared to manipulation with a 6 degree-of-freedom wand (or flystick), as well as with carrying out the same task in the real world. Users were also asked to perform a free task, allowing us to observe their perceived level of presence in the scene.

Rather than using a traditional wand device, users can manipulate objects with fingers of both hands in a close-to-natural manner for moderately complex, general purpose tasks. Our solution couples finger tracking with a real-time physics engine, combined with a heuristic approach for hand manipulation, which is robust to tracker noise and simulation instabilities. A first study has been performed to evaluate our interface, with tasks involving complex manipulations, such as balancing objects while walking in the cube. The user's finger-tracked manipulation was compared to manipulation with a 6 degree-of-freedom wand (or flystick), as well as with carrying out the same task in the real world. Users were also asked to perform a free task, allowing us to observe their perceived level of presence in the scene. Our results show that our approach provides a feasible interface for immersive cube environments and is perceived by users as being closer to the real experience compared to the wand.
